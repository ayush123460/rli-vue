        <p>Welcome to RL India, the largest community of the game Rocket League in Asia.</p>
        <p>Our core objective is to make Asian players, particularly Indian players, stronger at the game in order to bring RLCS to Asia and compete in major e-sport tournaments at the world stage. With the current rate of growth of this community, we are not far from achieving our goals.</p>
        <p>We host regular tournaments, scrims, lan events and more for our community to actively participate and have fun! Giveaways also happen frequently on our official partnered Discord server. Be sure to join it, to catch all our announcements. We also have a very active facebook group, so check that out as well.</p>

        <p>At RL India, we have one of the best staff members a gaming community can ever have. They work hard with dedication to complete goals and help the community in anyway they can; perhaps what drives them is the rapid day to day growth of our community.</p>
        <p>Our team consists of <i>admins, moderators, graphics designers, casters, streamers, video editors, web developers,</i> and <i>content writers</i>. We communicate daily on our discord server and share our progress on the assigned task so that we can complete work on time. Our roles in the team are clearly defined and we do what we are best at to support the team.</p>
        <p>We are looking to extend our team to bring in more talent and increase our quality whenever possible, so if you think you got what it takes to be one of us, apply now.</p>
